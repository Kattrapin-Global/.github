# Kattrapin Global: Engineering the Future of Technical Intelligence 🚀

## Our Mission
Kattrapin is evolving from a leader in technical documentation and industrial animation into a SaaS-first AI platform. We are building the world’s most advanced AI-assisted engine for the automated generation of technical documents and 3D animations, specifically designed for the manufacturing and industrial sectors.

## 🛠️ What We Are Building
Our India-based engineering hub is developing a proprietary **Technical Knowledge Graph** that integrates:

- **Data Ingestion:** Automatically extracting intelligence from CAD files, engineering specs, and legacy documentation.  
- **Knowledge Layer:** Mapping relationships between People, Utilities, Policies, and Appliances to create a structured "Second Brain" for industrial operations.  
- **Generative AI:** Leveraging LLMs and custom rendering engines to produce interactive, compliant technical assets in real-time.  
- **Cross-Platform Assistance:** A local-first, privacy-focused assistant (Desktop/iOS) that delivers proactive insights to field engineers and factory managers.

## 🏗️ Technical Stack
We are committed to a local-first, spec-driven development philosophy:

- **AI/ML:** Python, PyTorch, Azure OpenAI (Integrated)  
- **Backend:** High-performance data pipelines for Knowledge Graph management.  
- **Frontend:** Cross-platform development for seamless industrial workflows.  
- **Infrastructure:** Scalable GPU-accelerated cloud environments.

## 📍 Global Presence
With our primary R&D and IT team based in India, Kattrapin Global is bridging the gap between traditional engineering and the future of AI-driven automation.
